# Credit Risk Classification Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a supervised machine learning model for credit risk classification. The goal is to take in data regarding loan applicants, and predict whether it's status is healthy (`0`) or high risk (`1`). This involved the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing
  - Data was imported from a csv and separated into features and labels, as well as split into a training and testing set.
- Model training
  - Initializing and training the a logistic regression model to predict whether a loan was healthy or high risk
- Model analysis
  - Assessing model accuracy and performance
- Comparison of models
  - The above steps were completed twice.
    - First with the initial data source
    - Next with oversampled data that was generated by using the RandomOverSampler function
  - The models were then compared as shown in the analysis report below

## Results

The following table displays the classification reports from both of the models, where Class `0` represents healthy loans, and Class `1` represents high risk loans

| Model | Balanced Accuracy | Precision (Class 0) | Recall (Class 0) | F1-score (Class 0) | Precision (Class 1) | Recall (Class 1) | F1-score (Class 1) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Model 1 (Original Data) | 0.94 | 1.00 | 0.99 | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.91 | 0.88 |
| Model 2 (Oversampled Data) | 0.95 | 1.00 | 0.99 | 1.00 | 0.84 | 0.99 | 0.91 |

## Summary

Both models perform well when assessing healthy loans (`0`), but Model 2 (using the oversampled data) performs better when it comes to assessing high risk loans (`1`).

Model 2 is reccommended above Model 1 due to it's higher recall and f1-score for high risk loans (`1`) while maintaining Model 1's precision, recall, and f1-score for healthy loans (`0`). Assessing if a loan is high risk (`1`) is of great importance, as misclassifying them as healthy (`0`) could lead to a significant financial consequence.
